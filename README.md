There are a multitude of efforts to contribute to the relief efforts - food, cloth and money collection drives. But there is no single point that coordinates these efforts, resulting in logistical problems. A lot of the resources do not reach places that need them solely because of lack of data.

[sendtokerala.in](http://sendtokerala.in) was released to address this logistical need.

You can use this website to
1. Find out Addresses and phone numbers of collection centres by location.
2. Find out which collection centre sends to which relief centres.
3. Until what time each collection centre functions.

If you know of any collection centres that are not in the list currently, please add the details via [http://bit.ly/sendtokerala](http://bit.ly/sendtokerala). The data submitted via this form will be verified using the collected phone numbers by volunteers and will be included in the website.
